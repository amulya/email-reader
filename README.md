Python file that reads an excel sheet of RU netIDs and appends the scarletmail address so I have to do less work for USACS :D

Example excel file:
  asm229 
  asm229
  asm229

Resultant text file:
  asm229@scarletmail.rutgers.edu
  asm229@scarletmail.rutgers.edu
  asm229@scarletmail.rutgers.edu
  
Barely a hack but I'm terrified of file reading and the 'os' library in python so this definitely was a success for me haha.
